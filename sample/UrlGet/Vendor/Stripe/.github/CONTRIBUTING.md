Thanks for contributing to the Stripe iOS SDK. To balance our own internal prioritization with those of the open source community, we ask a few things of you:

- If you're confused about how to integrate Stripe into your iOS app, or having general iOS problems, please email support@stripe.com .

- If you think you've discovered a bug in our SDK, feel free to open an issue for it (or a pull request to fix it)!

- If you have a feature request, please open an issue for it. We'll let you know if we're already working on it, and what the timeline might be. We discourage submitting pull requests that add functionality without first discussing them with us in an issue, as we may not be able to merge them if they conflict with our existing plans.
