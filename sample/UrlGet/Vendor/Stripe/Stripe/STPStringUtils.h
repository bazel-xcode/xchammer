/**
 Takes a string with the named html-style tags, removes the tags,
 and then calls the completion block with the modified string and the range 
 in it that the tag would have enclosed.

 E.g. Passing in @"Test <b>string</b>" with tag @"b" would call completion
 with @"Test string" and NSMakeRange(5,6).

 Completion is always called, location of range is NSNotFound with the unmodified
 string if a match could not be found.

 @param string     The string with tagged substrings.
 @param tag        The tag to search for.
 @param completion The string with the named tag removed and the range of the
                   substring it covered.

/**
 Like `parseRangeFromString:withTag:completion:` but you can pass in a set
 of unique tags to get the ranges for and it will return you the mapping.

 E.g. Passing @"<a>Test</a> <b>string</b>" with the tag set [a, b]
 will get you a completion block dictionary that looks like
 @{ @"a" : NSMakeRange(0,4),
    @"b" : NSMakeRange(5,6) }

 @param string     The string with tagged substrings.
 @param tags       The tags to search for.
 @param completion The string with the named tags removed and the ranges of the
                   substrings they covered (wrapped in NSValue)

 @warning Doesn't currently support overlapping tag ranges because that's
          complicated and we don't need it at the moment.
