/**
 When you're using `STPPaymentContext` to request your user's payment details, this is the object that will be returned to your application when they've successfully made a payment. It currently just contains a `source`, but in the future will include any relevant metadata as well. You should pass `source.stripeID` to your server, and call the charge creation endpoint. This assumes you are charging a Customer, so you should specify the `customer` parameter to be that customer's ID and the `source` parameter to the value returned here. For more information, see https://stripe.com/docs/api#create_charge
