 This class can be used wherever you'd use a `UIActivityIndicatorView` and is intended to have a similar API. It renders as a spinning circle with a gap in it, similar to what you see in the App Store app or in the Apple Pay dialog when making a purchase. To change its color, set the `tintColor` property.
