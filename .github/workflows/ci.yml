# **THE FOLLOWING SEGMENT SHOULD BE KEPT IDENTICAL BETWEEN `CI.YML` UNTIL A BETTER IDEA COMES UP**
# Consider finding a way to unify this with `ci.yml`. Per the github actions
# docs, I'm not sure about how to do that.
# Github actions seems to want to run the jobs 2x when there is multiple `on` keywords
# e.g.  on: [pull_request, push]
