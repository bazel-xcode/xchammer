# **THE FOLLOWING SEGMENT SHOULD BE KEPT IDENTICAL BETWEEN `CI.YML` UNTIL A BETTER IDEA COMES UP**
# Consider finding a way to unify this with `ci.yml`. Per the github actions
# docs, I'm not sure about how to do that.
# Github actions seems to want to run the jobs 2x when there is multiple `on` keywords
# e.g.  on: [pull_request, push]
# https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions
jobs:
  # Note: currently we share the Bazel cache to speed up parallel jobs.
  # Ideally, we can update these jobs to use the a release artifact of XCHammer
  # once https://github.com/pinterest/xchammer/pull/258 is landed.
  # Ideally, it also can create a github release of XCHammer as well.
