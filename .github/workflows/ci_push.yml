# **THE FOLLOWING SEGMENT SHOULD BE KEPT IDENTICAL BETWEEN `CI.YML` UNTIL A BETTER IDEA COMES UP**
# Consider finding a way to unify this with `ci.yml`. Per the github actions
# docs, I'm not sure about how to do that.
# Github actions seems to want to run the jobs 2x when there is multiple `on` keywords
# e.g.  on: [pull_request, push]

  # Note: currently we share the Bazel cache to speed up parallel jobs.
  # Ideally, we can update these jobs to use the a release artifact of XCHammer
  # once https://github.com/pinterest/xchammer/pull/258 is landed.
  # Ideally, it also can create a github release of XCHammer as well.

  # This uploads `xchammer.zip` as an artifact to github actions
  # For issues mentioned here
  # https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/issues/50
  # The Github URL can't be used with Bazel directly in an `http_archive`
  # At the time of writing the only way to consume it is to:
  # - get the release URL with the github actions API which is valid for 1 minute
  # - pull the zip from that URL and re-host it: or somehow use it locally.
  # - it'd probably be possible to impalement as a github actions repository
  #   and that's a lot of unwarranted complexity to integrate XCHammer.
  #
  # See README.md of how to use the artifact with Bazel
