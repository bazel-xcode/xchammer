## Usage

_Note: this README is intended to be a minimal, quick start guide to XCHammer.
To learn more about XCHammer see [Introducing
XCHammer](Docs/FastAndReproducibleBuildsWithXCHammer.md) and [The XCHammer
FAQ](Docs/XCHammerFAQ.md). To learn more about Bazel, see [Bazel for iOS
developers](Docs/BazelForiOSDevelopers.md). To learn about how Pinterest uses
XCHammer see [Introducing

Xcode Projects](PinterestFocusedXcodeProjects.md)_

### Bazel build Xcode projects

First, pull XCHammer into the `WORKSPACE` file:

_Ideally, pull in a release optimized binary build to keep XCHammer's
dependencies, Swift version, Xcode version, compiler flags, Bazel version, and
build time outside of the main iOS/macOS application's WORKSPACE. To easily
achieve this, GitHub CI creates a binary release artifact on receiving a new
tag._

```py
# WORKSPACE
# Recommended approach - the CI auto releases when you push a tag matching `v*`
# The release prefix is the _tested_ bazel version, and XCHammer is often
# forwards and backwards compatible
http_archive(
    name = "xchammer",
    urls = [ "https://github.com/pinterest/xchammer/releases/download/v3.4.1.0/xchammer.zip" ],
)

```

Next, create an `xcode_project` target including targets:
```
# BUILD.Bazel
load("@xchammer//:xcodeproject.bzl", "xcode_project")
xcode_project(
    name = "MyProject",
    targets = [ "//ios-app:ios-app" ],
    paths = [ "**" ],
)
```

Finally, build the project with Bazel
```bash
bazel build MyProject
```

### CLI Usage ( Non Bazel built projects )

XCHammer also works as a standalone project generator. kirst build XCHammer and
install to the path:

```bash
# Installs to `/usr/local/bin/`
make install
```
Then, generate using a [XCHammerConfig](Sources/XCHammer/XCHammerConfig.swift).

```bash
xchammer generate <configPath>
```

## Configuration Format

XCHammer is configured via a `yaml` representation of [XCHammerConfig](https://github.com/pinterest/xchammer/blob/master/Sources/XCHammer/XCHammerConfig.swift).

The configuration describes projects that should be generated.

```yaml
# Generates a project containing the target ios-app
targets:
    - "//ios-app:ios-app"

projects:
    "MyProject":
        paths:
            - "**"
```

_See [XCHammerConfig.swift](https://github.com/pinterest/xchammer/blob/master/Sources/XCHammer/XCHammerConfig.swift) for detailed documentation of the format._

### Practical configuration examples

By default, XCHammer doesn't provide or enforce any build configuration
defaults.  It does exposes APIs to make it possible to configure Bazel options
Xcode dynamically, on a target level, on a project level, and on an
architecture level.

_When using the CLI the
XCHammerConfig.swift](https://github.com/pinterest/xchammer/blob/master/Sources/XCHammer/XCHammerConfig.swift)
is passed via an `.yml` file, and when using the `xcode_project` rule, the
`XCHammerConfig` is passed into the rule._

#### Project level

The parameter `bazel` makes it possible to select a wrapper command for Bazel.
In practice, this might be `bazelisk` or a wrapper script. In the case of
XCHammer's own Xcode project, it's [tools/bazelwrapper](tools/bazelwrapper) to
handle make variable substitution at build time.

The [configuration](BazelExtensions/BazelExtensions/xchammerconfig.bzl) option,
`build_bazel_platform_options` make it possible to configure architecture
specific settings for each target. Checkout
[sample/UrlGet/BUILD.bazel](sample/UrlGet/BUILD.bazel) passes a `config` per
architecture in an iOS app.

#### Target Level

The [configuration](BazelExtensions/BazelExtensions/xchammerconfig.bzl) option, `build_bazel_options` makes it possible, to
set extra options on bazel target.

Finally, the `build_bazel_template` makes it possible to run a script _inside_
of Xcode before and after building. This also allows the user to pass in Bazel
arguments at build time.

Checkout the [BUILD](BUILD.bazel) file and samples for examples.

#### Build Time - debugging and static analysis

At the time of writing, there should be a way to build in "debug mode" in order
for LLDB to work. One possibility is to set this a default and override when
releasing. By default, it's possible to pass variables to Bazel. For example,
in XCHammer's own Xcode project,
[tools/XCHammerXcodeRunscript.sh](tools/XCHammerXcodeRunscript.sh) it set's the
`compilation_mode` based on Xcode's `CONFIGURATION` variable.

For the purpose of running static analysis, linters, and enabling other
options, it's possible to pass in extra bazel arguments at build time. For
example you might hinge running static analyzer on the analysis action in Xcode
which sets `RUN_CLANG_STATIC_ANALYZER`. Bazel doesn't have a way to run linters
or static analysis so it's totally up to the user how to run this.

## Samples

- [a Objective-C iOS app](sample/UrlGet)
- [a Swift iOS app](sample/Tailor) 
- [a Swift macOS app](BUILD.bazel)


### Xcode progress bar integration

XCHammer provides a path to optionally integrate with Xcode's build system and
progress bar.

- Install support for Xcode's progress bar for Xcode 11

```
xchammer install_xcode_build_system
```

- add `--build_event_binary_file=/tmp/bep.bep` to your `.bazelrc`
- make sure Xcode's new build system is enabled


## LLDB integration

Under Swift and clang compilers, the execution root is written into debug info
in object files by default. XCHammer writes an lldbinit file to map this
directory to the source root of source code, so that both breakpoints and
sources work in Xcode.

To make outputs consistent and debuggable across machines, e.g. with remote
caching, it's recommended to use debug info remapping. Debug info remapping is a
technique that simply remaps absolute paths in debug info to a stable location.
LLDB then is able to map these to the source directory, via a
`target.source-map`. By default, these Bazel flags are not configured and
require adding additional flags to the build. Generally, these flags should set
in _your_ `.bazelrc` for every build.

Clang provides debug info remapping via the `-fdebug-prefix-map` flag. For
Objective-C, C, C++, debug info remapping is implemented at the crosstool level.
Configure Bazel to pass these arguments by setting
`--copt="DEBUG_PREFIX_MAP_PWD=."` or providing a custom crosstool.  See setting
up [crosstool
logic](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/tools/osx/crosstool/wrapped_clang.cc#L218)
for more info.

Starting with Xcode 10.2, Swift provides debug info remapping via the
`-debug-prefix-map` flag.  `rules_swift` supports the ability to [pass the debug
remapping](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift/commit/43900104d279fcdffbca2d02dbc550492bf33353).
Simply add `--swiftcopt=-Xwrapped-swift=-debug-prefix-pwd-is-dot` to remap debug
info in Swift.

XCHammer will automatically write a compatible remapping in the `.lldbinit`. Set
`HAMMER_USE_DEBUG_INFO_REMAPPING=YES` via an `xcconfig`. See [XCHammer's BUILD
file](BUILD.bazel), for an example of this.

_Generating a dSYM for development is not recommended due to the performance
hit, and in practice is only required for Instruments.app._
